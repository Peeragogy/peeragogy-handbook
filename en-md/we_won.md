### Different ways to analyze the learning process

After doing some personal reflection on the roles you want to take on
and the contributions you want to make (as we discussed above), you may
also want to work together with your learning group to analyze the
learning process in more detail. There are many different phases,
stages, and dimensions - some simple and intuitive, others more complex
-- that you can use to help structure and understand the learning
experience: we list some of these below. (Detailed references are
collected in the recommended readings at the end of the book.)

1.  Forming, Norming, Storming, Performing (from Bruce Tuckman)
2.  The “five-stage e-moderating model” (from Gilly Salmon)
3.  I, We, Its, It (from Ken Wilber -- for an application in modeling
    educational systems, see [1])
4.  Assimilative, Information Processing, Communicative, Productive,
    Experiential, Adaptive (from Martin Oliver and Gráinne Conole)
5.  Guidance & Support, Communication & Collaboration, Reflection &
    Demonstration, Content & Activities (from Gráinne Conole)
6.  Considered in terms of “Learning Power” (Ruth Deakin-Crick *et al*.)
7.  Multiple intelligences (after Howard Gardner)
8.  The associated “mental state” (after Mihaly Csíkszentmihályi; see
    picture)

### Peer learning for one

Can you apply the ideas of peer learning on your own? In a certain
sense, it’s impossible, but somehow that never stops people from trying.
We find a striking parallel between the paragogy principles and the 5
Elements of Effective Thinking proposed by Edward Burger and Michael
Starbird in a recent book [2]. It’s a nice short book and worth a read.
Here, we will just quote the titles of the main chapters:

1.  Quintessence, Engaging Change: Transform Yourself
2.  Earth, Grounding Your Thinking: Understanding Deeply
3.  Air, Creating Questions out of Thin Air: Be your own Socrates
4.  Water, Seeing the Flow of Ideas: Look Back, Look Forward
5.  Fire, Igniting Insights through Mistakes: Fail to Succeed

We think that “thinking” is often most effective when it’s done with
others, and this is something that Burger and Starbird don’t give much
attention. Nevertheless, even when you find yourself on your own in the
midst of that challenging DIY project, you can use the techniques of
peer learning to understand yourself as a growing, changing part of a
shared context in motion. This can contribute to an effective and
adaptive outlook on life.

We invite you to approach this book as a “peer learner” -- and we hope
the techniques we’ve introduced here will serve you well in the world at
large. The book, in part, documents the growth of our subject as it
moved from a critical and basically normative view to a richer
descriptive theory, rooted in a collection strategies for doing emergent
design. It's been fun -- and worthwhile (if also frustrating at times)
-- working on it. We sincerely hope you enjoy the rest of the book, but
don't be sparing with your criticism and creative ideas! You'll find
some further reflections on these matters in the sections on
[peeragogical assessment](http://peeragogy.org/assessment/ "Assess").
