Personal Learning Networks are the collections of people and information
resources (and relationships with them) that people cultivate in order
to form their own public or private learning networks — living, growing,
responsive sources of information, support, and inspiration that support
self-learners.

### Strong and weak ties

Your PLN will have people and sites that you check on often – your main
sources of information and learning – your ‘strong ties’. Your ‘weak
ties’ are those people and sites that you don’t allow a lot of bandwidth
or time. But they may become strong later, as your network grows or your
interests expand. This is a two-way street – it is very important that
you are sharing what you learn and discover with those in your network
and not just taking, if you want to see your network expand.

### Peer learning networks

As you convene your peer learning group, in one form or another you will
develop and share "peeragogical profiles" --- advertising what you want
to learn, what you'd be interested in helping teach others. If you
present yourself and your projects in a thoughtful and engaging way,
this will help you to build effective connections. Networks of these
connections can span across different subjects, across a city, or across
national boundaries. Peeragogy helps to make sense of the idea of
"learning networks" that has been around since at least the 1970s. Much
as theories of pedagogy would be relevant for anyone carefully planning
an individual learning programme, peeragogy is relevant for
self-organized learning communities operating at larger scales.
