*October, 2011*. Tom's day-job involves finding patterns in market data
(see [Kevin Slavin’s TED
talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world.html)).
He reads philosophy and does some other programming work in his spare
time. However, he doesn't take the Occupy Wall Street protest very
seriously. But one of these evenings, one of the protestors catches his
attention. She’s dressed rather strikingly. They talk, and he comes away
thinking about something she said: “*[All our grievances are
interconnected](http://www.nycga.net/files/2011/11/DeclarationFlowchart_v2_large.jpg).*”
What if all the solutions are interconnected too? Night time: Tom
becomes increasingly obsessed with this idea. He’s pulling down lots of
web pages from the internet — again, looking for patterns. What would it
take for OWS folks to solve the problems they worry so much about? He
starts working on a tool that’s geared towards learning and sharing
skills, while working on real projects. At first, it’s just hackers who
are using the tool, but over time they adapt it for popular use. Things
start to get interesting… [caption id="" align="aligncenter"
