Consider the following learning scenarios:
1.  A small study group for a tough class in Quantum Mechanics convenes
    at at the library late one night, resolving to do well on the next
    day’s exam. The students manage to deflect their purpose for a while
    by gossiping about hook-ups and parties, studying for other classes,
    and sharing photos. Then, first one member, then another, takes the
    initiative and as a group, the students eventually pull their
    attention back to the task at hand. They endure the monotony of
    studying for several hours, and the next day, they own the exam.
2.  A young skateboarder spends hours tweaking the mechanics of how to
    make a skateboard float in the air for a split second, enduring
    physical pain of repeated wipeouts. With repetition and success
    comes a deep understanding of the physics of the trick. That same
    student cannot string together more than five minutes of continuous
    attention during class and spends even less time on homework for the
    class before giving up.

Peer-learning participants succeed when they are motivated to learn.
Skateboarding is primarily intrinsically motivated, with some extrinsic
motivation coming from the respect that kids receive from peers when
they master a trick. In most cases, the primary motivation for learning
physics is extrinsic, coming from parents' and society’s expectations
that the student excel and assure his or her future by getting into a
top college.
The student very well could be intrinsically motivated to have a glowing
report card, but not for the joy of learning physics or chemistry, but
because of the motivation to earn a high grade as part of her overall
portfolio. Taken a different way, what is it about these topics that’s
fun for a student who loves science? Perhaps she anticipates the
respect, power and prestige that comes from announcing a new
breakthrough; or she may feel her work is important for the greater
good, or prosperity, of humanity; or she may simply be thrilled to think
about atoms bonding to form new compounds.

Learning situations frequently bore the learner when extrinsic
motivation is involved. Whether by parents or society, being forced to
do something, as opposed to choosing to, ends up making the individual
less likely to succeed. In some cases it’s clear, but trying to figure
out what makes learning fun for a group of individual humans can be very
difficult. Often there is no clear-cut answer that can be directly
applied in the learning environment. Either way, identifying the factors
that can make learning boring or fun is a good start. Perhaps learning
certain skills or topics is intrinsically boring, no matter what, and we
have to accept that.

One way to think about fun learning is that it’s fun to learn - and be
aware that you're learning - new patterns. Jürgen Schmidhuber wrote: “A
[...] learner maximizes expected fun by finding or creating data that is
better compressible in some yet unknown but learnable way, such as
jokes, songs, paintings, or scientific observations obeying novel,
unpublished laws” [1]. So the skateboarder enjoyed coming across new
patterns: novel tricks that are learnable. (By the way, a few people,
like mathematician William Stein, find ways to combine the love of
science and skateboarding.)

## Learner, know thyself: a self-evaluation technique

The learning contributed and acquired by each member of the peer
learning enterprise depends on a healthy sense of self-awareness. When
you ask yourself, “What do I have to offer?” and “What do I get out of
it?” we think you’ll come up with some exciting answers. In peer
learning, whether or not you're pursuing a practical objective, you’re
in charge, and this kind of learning is usually fun. Indeed, as we’ll
describe below, there are deep links between play and learning. We
believe we can improve the co-learning experience by adopting a playful
mindset. Certainly some of our best learning moments in the Peeragogy
project have been peppered with humor and banter. So we found that a key
strategy for successful peer learning is to engage in a self-assessment
of your motivations and abilities. In this exercise, you take into
account factors like the learning context, timing and sequence of
learning activities, social reinforcements, and visible reward. The
peeragogical view is that learning is most effective when it contains
some form of enjoyment or satisfaction, or when it leads to a concrete
accomplishment.
When joining the Peeragogy project, Charles Jeffrey Danoff did a brief
self-evaluation about what makes him interested in learning:

1.  **Context**. I resist being groomed for some unforeseeable future
    rather than for a specific purpose.
2.  **Timing and sequence**. I find learning fun when I’m studying
    something as a way to procrastinate on another pressing assignment.
3.  **Social reinforcement**. Getting tips from peers on how to navigate
    a snowboard around moguls was more fun for me than my Dad showing me
    the proper way to buff the car’s leather seats on chore day.
4.  **Experiential awareness**. In high school, it was not fun to sit
    and compose a 30-page reading journal for Frankenstein. But owing in
    part to those types of prior experiences, I now find writing
    pleasurable and it’s fun to learn how to write better.

We will explore the patterns of peer learning in more detail in the
section on [practice](http://peeragogy.org/practice/).
