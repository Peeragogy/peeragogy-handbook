## The interplay of individual and group

“Personal” supports “peer”. We can consciously cultivate living,
growing, responsive webs of information, support, and inspiration that
help us be more effective learners. This is known as a personal learning
network. We’ll offer tips on how to build these networks — and we’ll
also explain how strong personal learning networks can contribute to and
evolve into even stronger peer learning networks.

“Peer” supports “personal”. As we work together to develop shared plans
for our collective efforts in group projects, we usually can find places
where we have something to learn. Furthermore, if we are willing to ask
for help and offer our help to others, everybody’s learning escalates.
Being mindful of effective interpersonal learning patterns is an
important part of building an effective personal learning plan.

## Peer learning through the ages

As you will have guessed, our new term, peeragogy, is a riff on the word
pedagogy — the art, science, or profession of teaching. Pedagogy has a
somewhat problematic origin: it comes from the ancient Greek tradition
of having a child (paidos) be supervised (agogos) by a slave. Greek
philosophers seem to have disagreed about to the best way for
individuals to gain knowledge (and even more so, wisdom). Socrates, who
insisted that he was not wise, also insisted that his interlocutors join
him in investigating truth claims, as peers. And yet, Plato, the most
famous of these interlocutors and the best-known author of Socratic
dialogs, in his most famous allegory of the cave, has Socrates say, with
a modest but clearly pedagogical bent:

> **Socrates**: This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear
> Glaucon, to the previous argument; the prison-house is the world of
> sight, the light of the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend
> me if you interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul
> into the intellectual world according to my poor belief, which, at
> your desire, I have expressed—whether rightly or wrongly God knows.
> But, whether true or false, my opinion is that in the world of
> knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen only with
> an effort; and, when seen, is also inferred to be the universal author
> of all things beautiful and right, parent of light and of the lord of
> light in this visible world, and the immediate source of reason and
> truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power upon which he
> who would act rationally either in public or private life must have
> his eye fixed.

In more recent centuries, various education theorists and reformers have
challenged the effectiveness of what had become the traditional
teacher-led model. Most famous of the early education reformers in the
United States was John Dewey, who advocated new experiential learning
techniques. In his 1916 book, *Democracy and Education* [1], Dewey
wrote, “Education is not an affair of ‘telling’ and being told, but an
active and constructive process.” Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky, who
developed the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, was another
proponent of “constructivist” learning. His book, *Thought and Language*
[2] also gives evidence to support collaborative, socially meaningful,
problem-solving activities as opposed to isolated exercises.

Within the last few decades, things have begun to change very rapidly.
In "Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age," George Siemens
argues that technology has changed the way we learn, explaining how it
tends to complicate or expose the limitations of the learning theories
of the past [3]. The crucial point of connectivism is that the
connections that make it possible for us to learn in the future are more
relevant than the knowledge we hold individually in the present.
Technology can, to some degree and in certain contexts, replace "know
how" with "know where to look."

## From peer learning to peeragogy

The idea that we needed a new theory (which we initially gave the name
"paragogy" [4]) arose out of the challenges we faced doing peer
learning. Our aim was to understand how groups and organizations can
become better at serving participants’ interests, while participants
also learn and become better contributors.

Paragogy began as a set of proposed principles that describe peer
produced peer learning -- we’ll say what these principles are just
below. We designed them to contrast with a set guidelines for adult
educators advanced by Malcolm Knowles [5]. The paragogy principles focus
on the way in which co-learners shape their learning context together.
Very likely, there will be no educator anywhere in sight. And just for
this reason, peer produced peer learning is something for “innovative
educators” everywhere. You don’t need to have the word teacher, trainer,
or educator in your job title. It’s enough to ask good questions.

The paragogy principles aim to make that more explicit. They advocate
for an approach to peer learning in which:

1.  Changing context is a decentered center.
2.  Meta-learning is a font of knowledge.
3.  Peers provide feedback that wouldn't be there otherwise.
4.  Learning is distributed and nonlinear.
5.  You realize the dream if you can, then wake up!

If some of these principles seem a bit ephemeral, it may help to think
of in a more unified manner, as a set of dimensions that describe
possible changes that can take place in peer produced peer learning [6]:

1.  Changing the nature of the space
2.  Changing what I know about myself
3.  Changing my perspective
4.  Changing content or connectivity
5.  Changing objectives

Now that we've connecting the idea of paragogy to a perspective focused
on the kinds of change that can take place in peer produced peer
learning, it's time to reveal that our secret for success is hidden in
plain view: the word “paragogy” means “production” in Greek. We’re
particularly interested in how the powerful blend of peer learning and
collaborative work drives open source software development, and helps to
build resources like Wikipedia. But in fact it works equally well in
offline settings, from official hacker/maker spaces to garages and
treehouses. Projects like [StoryCorps](http://storycorps.org/about/)
show how contemporary media can add a powerful new layer to ancient
strategies for teaching, learning, and sharing.

The word “peeragogy” attempts to make these ideas immediately
understandable to everyone, including non-geeks. Peeragogy is about
peers learning together, and teaching each other. In the end, the two
words are actually synonyms. If you want to go into theory-building
mode, you can spell it “paragogy”. If you want to be a bit more down to
earth, stick with “peeragogy.”
