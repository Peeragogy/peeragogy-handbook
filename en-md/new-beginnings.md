Once he gets to the Whispering Gallery, Jorge realizes that the girl was
right. This *is* the center of the universe. There are murmurs to be
heard there – it seems they come from everywhere. He hears about guilds
and the craftsmen who built the cathedral. He learns about how proud
they were and how they formed communities of practice, educating the
uninitiated, teaching each other to create. He returns to ground level.
The girl is gone, but he feels happy and inspired. He can do much more
then repackage social media streams; there is more going on here than
Twitter as a new broadcast medium. He starts a new journey: finding a
guild, a community of practice, but restyled in a 21st century fashion.
It will be more open, more connected to others then the old guilds. He
will still use Twitter, a social dashboard, and curating tools, but also
he uses wikis, and synchronous communication. And most importantly, he
starts building, together with others -- in particular, together with
the people formerly known as his readers. They will co-create the
analysis, the search for solutions and sense-making, rather than
helplessly listening to “experts”, passively consuming pre-processed
knowledge and information. Instead, they’ll start building their own
destiny, and the newsroom will be part of the platform. [caption id=""
