'''Main actors'''

The non-executive (Jim, Pamela, Julian) and executive (Clare, Malcolm, Colin &amp; Jenny) directors of a housing association (a not-for-profit organisation building and letting &quot;social&quot; housing for families in housing need) '''Main success scenario'''

# The board of the housing association need to set a strategy that takes account of significant changes in legislation, the UK [welfare] benefits system and the availability of long term construction loans.
# Julian, eager to make use of his new-found peeragogical insights suggests an approach where individuals research specific factors and the team work together to draw out themes and strategic options. As a start he proposes that each board member researches an area of specific knowledge or interest.
# Jim, the Chairman, identifies questions he wants to ask the Chairs of other Housing Associations. Pamela (a lawyer) agrees to do an analysis of the relevant legislation. Clare, the CEO, plans out a series of meetings with the local councils in the boroughs of interest to understand their reactions to the changes from central government. Jenny, the operations director, starts modelling the impact on occupancy from new benefits rules. Colin, the development director, re-purposes existing work on options for development sites to reflect different housing mixes on each site. Malcolm, the finance director, prepares a briefing on the new treasury landscape and the changing positions of major lenders.
# Each member of the board documents their research in a private wiki. Julian facilitates some synchronous and asynchronous discussion to draw out themes in each area and map across the areas of interest. Malcolm, the FD, adapts his financial models to take differet options as parameters.
# Clare refines the themes into a set of strategic options for the association, with associated financial modelling provided by Malcolm.
# Individual board members explore the options asynchronously before convening for an all-day meeting to confirm the strategy.

'''Thoughts'''

# This may be a little close to the &quot;peer production&quot; end of peeragogy, but on the other hand, where (if anywhere) do we draw the line?
# This probably needs to be made a little more abstract to be a useful use case, and in doing so I suspect will start to overlap with [http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/forum/patterns-and-use-cases#comment-1509 Pæragogy helps solve complex problems]
# It looks to me as if there may be some candidate patterns buried in this use case, e.g. Environment Scanning, Codifying Specialist Knowledge, Extracting Themes, Modelling Outcomes, Consensus Building
