This document is a practical guide to co-learning, a living document
that invites comment and invites readers to join the community of
editors. The document does not have to be read in linear order from
beginning to end.~ Material about conceptualizing and convening
co-learning -- the stuff that helps with getting started -- is located
toward the top of the table of contents. Material about~use cases,
resources, and assessment is located toward the bottom.~ Hop around if
you'd like.

We've focused on ``hands-on'' techniques, and you'll probably want to
try things out with your own groups and networks as you read.

  If you want a starter syllabus, check out
  ``\href{http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-in-action/}{Peeragogy in
  Action}'' in the resources section.
\item
  If you want to delve directly into the research literature, our
  initial literature survey forms the basis of a
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_learning}{Wikipedia article},
  and the book also includes additional
  \href{http://peeragogy.org/recommended-reading/}{recommended
  readings}.
\item
  For something lighter, many pages in the online version of the book
  include short introductory videos, most of them under one minute
  long.~ You can do a
  \href{http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=peeragogy\&sm=3}{search
  on YouTube} to find these and many of our other videos all in one
  place.

%% ~ We might
%% quote you in future versions of the book to help improve the resource
%% for others, like this:

%% \textbf{John Glass}: Reading through the handbook, it strikes me that
%% the users will be fairly sophisticated folks. They will have ample
%% knowledge of various tech platforms, resources, a fair amount of formal
%% education, access and ability to use a number of different gadgets. My
%% dilemma is that I am thinking that Peeragogy, at its most basic, seems
%% to be about facilitating P2P learning. As such, at its most basic, it
%% would be about assisting people to work together to learn something (and
%% for me, learning encompasses virtually all human behavior, with the
%% possible exception of that controlled by the autonomic nervous system
%% and even there I am not sure). In other words, I am thinking it is about
%% helping anyone learn through partnership with others (group \emph{A})
%% and yet the handbook appears to be geared toward a rather specialized
%% group of people (group \emph{B}). I guess what I am looking for is
%% perhaps some clarification on who is the intended audience, \emph{A} or
%% \emph{B}? As it stands, I am unsure how it could realistically apply to
%% \emph{A}\ldots{}Thanks.

%% \textbf{Joe Corneli}: I think that the best thing to do is to do this in
%% dialog.~ In addition to groups \emph{A} and \emph{B}, we might need a
%% group \emph{C}, who would mediate between the two.~~ The assignment
%% would be something like this: ``Use this to structure the class, and if
%% you get stuck at any point or if you think the resource isn't the right
%% one,~ ask me for help, and we'll work on finding other solutions
%% together.''~ At the end of the semester, you might have a new and very
%% different book tailored to this particular ``audience'' (or ``public''
%% to use Howard's term)!~ That would be cool.~ The current book definitely
%% isn't a one-size-fits-all -- I'd say it's more like a sewing machine.~
%% In fact, I think group \emph{C} is the real ``public'' for this book --
%% not experts, but people who will say: ``How can I use the ideas and the
%% process here to do something new?''~ What people do with it will
%% definitely depend on the goal: the model might be \emph{Stand and
%% Deliver} or it might be \emph{Good Will Hunting} or it may be something
%% very different.~ Our long-term goal is not to build a 1000 page version
%% of the handbook, but to serve as a ``hub'' that can help many different
%% peer learning projects.~ The first question is: How can we improve the
%% usability for you?~ Rather than tackling the whole book all at once, I
%% would recommend that we start by dialoging about the
%% ``\href{http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-in-action/}{Peeragogy in
%% Action}'' syllabus at the end.~ How would we have to tailor that to suit
%% the needs of your students?~ With that in mind, another useful starting
%% point might be our article on
%% \href{http://peeragogy.org/the-student-authored-syllabus/}{the student
%% authored syllabus}.~ Finally, our motto for the book is: ``\emph{This is
%% a How-To Handbook}.''~ We can talk more about anything that's confusing
%% and get rid of or massively revise anything that's not useful.~ That's a
%% super-micro guide to doing peeragogy.
