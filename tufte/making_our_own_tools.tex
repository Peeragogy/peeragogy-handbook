\subsection{Main Actor}

Howard runs \href{http://www.rheingold.com/university/}{Rheingold
University} and teaches courses at UCB and Stanford.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Howard created the peeragogy project, as a place to experiment and
  learn: ``I want to experiment as much as possible with peeragogy, with
  the group of contributors here, with the co-learners in Rheingold U,
  and with other groups in the future. I want to personally use the
  tools we're building. I know something about how to do it, and can
  make substantial contributions. But I also am learning a lot about how
  to do it from others, and expect that to continue.''
\item
  Although ``bringing a volunteer project to completion {[}\ldots{}{]}
  isn't a guaranteed slam-dunk'', Howard learns by doing: ``If I had it
  to do over again, I would have thought out the work flow and
  delineated it before we started talking about how to do the project.''
\item
  With both frequent, and other less frequent, but thoughtful,
  contributors, the project continues to develop, and will indeed
  complete somehow (even if no one knew quite what to expect in
  advance). Howard and other contributors have learned a lot in the
  process - and this will be useful both for the duration of the
  peeragogy project, and in future projects. As hoped!
\end{enumerate}
