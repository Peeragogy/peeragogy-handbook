\subsection{Main Actor}

Jess, a hacker and engineer who develops new libraries and programs
quickly and on the bleeding edge of new technologies.

\subsection{Main success scenario}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Jess develops something new and totally cool and drops the source code
  in GitHub. These tools are developed rapidly and are a much lighter
  ``learning lift'' than learning say an entirely new programming
  language.
\item
  She creates documentation for her new library and puts it up on a web
  site for other developers to read.
\item
  She is trying to find a better way for other developers to learn how
  to use the new tools and libraries she creates and starts thinking
  about peer learning.
\item
  How can she use what tools and processes or methods that are already
  out there to engage other developers to learn from and with each other
  digitally? (Jess has no background in learning theory and is not in
  the educational field.) She finds the peeragogy handbook and a lot of
  this stuff starts to click.
\end{enumerate}
