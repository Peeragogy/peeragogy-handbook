\paragraph{Motivation} This pattern can help project participants get started, get focused, and make concrete change. It is especially useful for someone who is currently feeling stuck.

\paragraph{Context}
%DK This seems like a problem…I would think that the context would be something like "there is an existing shared project with a lot of parts/scope, etc."
We often find ourselves confronted with what seems to be a difficult, complex, or even insurmountable problem. It won't go away, but a workable solution doesn't present itself, either. If there is a candidate solution, it's also clear there are not enough resources for it to be feasible.

\paragraph{Problem}
We are often blinded by our own prejudices and preferences. Considerable energy goes into pondering, discussing, exploring and feeling stuck. Meanwhile there may be a strong urge to make more concrete progress, and time is passing by. In a group setting, when the forward-movers ultimately try to act, those who are more wrapped up in the experience of pondering and exploring may rebel, if they feel that they are being left behind. Inaction may seem like the only safe choice, but it has risks too.  Once things are moving, it's easy to get stuck again.

\paragraph{Solution} 
One way to make progress when you're stuck is to ask a specific question to someone who may be able to help you get unstuck. Formulating a question helps your thinking become more concrete. Sometimes you'll see that a solution was within your grasp all along.  Often, one question won't be enough, but you can repeat the process. In this way, you can reduce a large, complex, or ephemeral concern into a collection of smaller, specific, manageable tasks with clear next steps and success criteria. Use a \patternname{Scrapbook} to make note of all the small things, and weave them into your project \patternname{Roadmap}. This will show how the small pieces relate to the bigger picture. If you have a fairly specific idea about what you want to do, but you're finding it difficult to get it done, don't just ask for advice: recruit material help (cf.~\patternname{Carrying capacity}). One example of a specific project from the Peeragogy project is our work on this paper, which had a specific target audience, a set of associated deadlines, and allowed us to get help from pattern experts. 

% DK: This seems a bit speculative, “If you are able…” What steps does this solution entail? How do you know that a project is sufficiently specific? The front part of the pattern makes it sound like the point of view of the pattern is from someone coming into a project looking for something to do, but is there a piece of this pattern for people on a project with ideas about what to do but without the bandwidth to do it? I.e. someone populating the Roadmap with Specific Projects Is there some risk about being too specific about a project?
\paragraph{Rationale} 
We've seen time and again that having a specific project is a recipe for getting concrete, and that getting concrete is necessary for bringing about change. Asking for help (which is what happens when you vocalize a question) is one of the best ways to gain coherence. Making yourself understood can go a long way toward resolving deeper difficulties.

%OSS: Tell a lightning story for your resolution? We talk about questions a lot. Confusing? Avoid question and talk more specifically about projects
\paragraph{Resolution}
Where you run into \textbf{difficulty}, getting specific paves the way for incremental forward progress and helps to overcome \textbf{inertia}. The struggle between consensus and action is resolved in a tangible project that combines action with dialog. Learning something new is a strong sign that things are working.
In the Peeragogy project, we have completed many projects during our weekly hangouts, for example ``hive editing'' an abstract for submission to a conference.

At first glance, the Wikimedia Foundation's mission presents an overwhelming concept.\footnote{\url{https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Mission_statement}} Where do we get started on a project with a global scale? How do we organise work?
%%%%
In practice, many future Wikipedians jump in, get to know other Wikipedia users, and start working on a focused todo list in
\patternname{A specific project}.

Within Wikipedia, these are known as ``WikiProjects.''\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Directory}}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Guide}}

\paragraph{Example 2}
%   Between class, studying, tests, papers, exams, friendships, sports, student life, remembering to eat, and more it is easy to get lost and give up.
% life for incoming students can become overwhelming quickly.
A shared Dormitory is typically unnecessary if studying from where you
currently live is an option.  That said, a short-term rental
or a time-shared cooperatively-owned living\slash working environment
could be an asset for peeragogues who need to get together 
to work on \patternname{A specific project}.  Collegial (and convivial) peer support
is important even without long-term co-habitation.
