\paragraph{Motivation} This pattern shows how the group can define the scope of their project and make a realistic plan to address it.  This pattern provides the backbone of our pattern language.  It can be used to find a shared goal.


\paragraph{Context} \patternname{Peeragogy} has both distributed and centralized aspects. The discussants or contributors who collaborate on a project have different points of view and heterogeneous priorities, but they come together in conversations and joint activities.

\paragraph{Problem} In order to collaborate, people need a way to share current, though incomplete, understanding of the space they are working in, and to nurture relationships with one another and the other elements of this space.  At the outset, there may not even be a coherent vision for a project -- but a only loose collection of motivations and sentiments.  Once the project is up and running, people are likely to pull in different directions.   

\paragraph{Solution}  Building a guide to the goals, activities, experiments and working methods can help \patternnameplural{Newcomer} and old-timers alike understand how the nature of their relationship with the project.  %% This guide may be a research question or an outline, an organizational mission statement, or a business plan.
It may combine features of a manifesto, a syllabus, and an issue tracker.  It may be a design pattern or a pattern language \cite{kohls2010structure}.  The distinguishing qualities of a project \patternname{Roadmap} are that it should be adaptive to circumstances, and that it should ultimately get us from \emph{here} to \emph{there}.  By this same token, any given version of the roadmap is seen as fallible.  %% Everyone with an interest in the project should have the right to update it, although in practice not everyone will choose to do so.
% * <Charles Danoff> 15:21:53 29 Nov 2015 UTC-0600:
% Should we add the business canvas?
In lieu of widespread participation, the project's \patternname{Wrapper} should attempt to synthesize an accurate roadmap that is informed by participants' behavior, and should help moderate in case of conflict.  Nevertheless, full consensus is not necessary: different goals, with different \emph{heres} and \emph{theres}, can be pursued separately, while maintaining communication.

\paragraph{Rationale} 
% DK: This seems more like advice about how to implement the solution than it is an explanation of how the solution addresses the forces from the context/problem [jc: fixed]
In the Peeragogy project our initial roadmap was an outline of the
first draft of the \emph{Peeragogy Handbook}.  
Later, it took the form
of a schedule of meetings following a regular
``\patternname{Heartbeat}'' supplemented by a list of upcoming
deadlines.  Most recently, it is expressed in the emergent
objectives listed in Section \ref{sec:Distributed_Roadmap} of the
current paper.  We have seen that a list of nice-to-have features created
in a top-down fashion is comparatively unlikely to \emph{go} anywhere.
A backlog of tasks and a realistic plan for accomplishing them are
vastly different things.  An adaptive roadmap is an
antidote to \patternnameext{Tunnel Vision}
\cite[pp. 121--124]{david2001software}. 

\paragraph{Resolution}
% DK: This seems like Rationale to me [jc: fixed]
An emergent roadmap is rooted in real problems and justifiable
solutions-in-progress in all their \textbf{variety} and communicates
both resolution and follow-through.  The process of meshing varied
issues with one another requires thought and discussion, and this
encourages \textbf{clarity}.  The test of \textbf{coherence} is that
% * <Charles Danoff> 15:40:10 29 Nov 2015 UTC-0600:
% lisa: getting everyone on the same page + clarity even if what you're doing is not clear
contributed goals and ideas should be actionable.
%
% - what happens if you don't have a roadmap?
The ultimate quality-control test is if it worked, i.e., did it come to pass that the task(s) the roadmap was created to achieve ended up being achieved, or not?  If all of the issues that the roadmap outlines are not resolved, the roadmap itself should be revised. Without a roadmap, we would never know.

% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleaning_up_vandalism is another localized roadmap.
\paragraph{Example 1}  The \emph{Help} link present on every Wikipedia page could be seen as a
localized \patternname{Roadmap} for individual user
engagement: it tells users what they can do withthe site, and gives instructions on how to do it.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents}}
%% It tells users what they can do on the site, and gives instructions
%% about how to do it:
%% \begin{quotation}
%% \noindent 
%% I want to \emph{read} or \emph{find} an article \ldots; 
%% I want to \emph{edit} an article \ldots;
%% I want to \emph{report a problem} with an article \ldots;
%% I want to \emph{create a new article} or \emph{upload media} \ldots;
%% I have a \emph{factual question}\ldots
%% ~[Etc.]
%% \end{quotation}
For someone who is prepared to jump in and get to work, there are
around 30 pages listing articles with various kinds of problems, for
example articles tagged with style issues, or ``orphaned'' articles
(i.e., articles with no links from other pages in the
encyclopedia).\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_article_cleanup}}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_style_issues}}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_orphaned_articles}}

Wikimedia previously developed
a detailed strategic plan drawing on community input
\cite{wikimedia2011plan}.  In 2015, a two-week 
Community Consultation was carried out and
synthesized, resulting in ``a direction that will guide the decisions for the organization.''\footnote{\url{https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/02/23/strategy-consultation/}}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{\url{https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/08/27/strategy-potential-mobile-multimedia-translation/}}

\paragraph{Example 2}
In a future university run in a peer produced manner, a fancy
President's Residence presumably wouldn't be needed.  Leadership would
be carried out in a more collaborative and distributed fashion.
However, depending on just how distributed things are, it may turn out
to be useful for project facilitators to gather at a University Hall.
Whereas there is strength in numbers, there is leverage in
organization.  This is what the \patternname{Roadmap} provides.\oldfootnote{The idea of a free\slash libre\slash open university remains somewhat contentious within the Peeragogy project.  See \url{https://github.com/Peeragogy/peeragogy-handbook/blob/master/en/Peeragogy-Business_Model_Canvas.pdf} for some ideas that might help us get there -- or somewhere else.}
