\subsubsection{Main actor}

Javier, who works for the European Commission.

\subsubsection{Main success scenario}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Javier is interested in research topics like ``data analytics'' and
  ``emerging topics in ICT'' -- things that will influence learning
  technology in the next 5 years. He is also concerned about how best to
  fund work on new learning and teaching environments.
\item
  He wonders what the barriers and incentives are in this niche. For
  example, why does research work frequently not have the broad-scale
  societal impact that the EC hopes it might?
\item
  Javier is invited to a pæragogy event, in which some unexpected
  experts on ``broad scale impact'' help him understand that intensive
  funding for research is often not going to have the desired effect,
  since, for various reasons, even well-funded research projects are
  frequently not well connected to actual practice.
\item
  He starts to build pæragogy into funding calls: smaller pots of money
  going to projects that connect with what people actually do, working
  with partners like the Wikimedia Foundation and the Free Software
  Foundation to multiply effort by involving volunteers. It's time for
  him to take a well-earned vacation.
