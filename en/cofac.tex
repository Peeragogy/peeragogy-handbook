Facilitation is a process of helping groups work cooperatively and
effectively. Facilitation can be particularly helpful for individuals
who, based on a certain level of insecurity or inexperience, tend to
lurk rather than participate. At the same time, it in peeragogy, a
facilitator isn't necessarily an ``authority'': rather, facilitation
work is done in service to the group and the group dialogue and process.
For example, a facilitator may simply ``hold space'' for the group, by
setting up a meeting or a regular series of discussions.

\subsection{Co-facilitating in peer-to-peer learning}

Co-facilitation can be found in collaborations between two or more
people who need each other to complete a task, for example, learn about
a given subject, author a technical report, solve a problem, or conduct
research Dee Fink writes that ``in this process, there has to be some
kind of change in the learner. No change, no learning'' {[}1{]}.
Significant learning requires that there be some kind of lasting change
that is important in terms of the learner's life; in peeragogy, one way
to measure the effectiveness of co-facilitation is to look for a change
in the peer group.

Co-facilitation roles can be found in groups/teams like basketball,
health, Alcoholics Anonymous, spiritual groups, etc. For example,
self-help groups are composed of people who gather to share common
problems and experiences associated with a particular problem,
condition, illness, or personal circumstance. There are some further
commonalities across different settings. Commenting on the work of Carl
Rogers:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Godfrey Barrett-Lennard}: The educational situation which most
effectively promotes significant learning is one in which (1) threat to
the self of the learner is reduced a minimum, and (2) differentiated
perception of the field of experience is facilitated. {[}2{]}

\end{quote}
Part of the facilitator's role is to create a safe place for learning to
take place; but they should also challenge the participants.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{John Heron}: Too much hierarchical control, and participants
become passive and dependent or hostile and resistant. They wane in
self-direction, which is the core of all learning. Too much cooperative
guidance may degenerate into a subtle kind of nurturing oppression, and
may deny the group the benefits of totally autonomous learning. Too much
autonomy for participants and laissez-faire on your part, and they may
wallow in ignorance, misconception, and chaos. {[}3{]}
\end{quote}
\subsection{Co-facilitating discussion forums}

If peers are preparing a forum discussion, here are some ideas from
``\href{http://ctb.ku.edu/en/tablecontents/section\_1180.aspx}{The
Community Tool Box}'', that can be helpful as guidelines:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item
  Explain the importance of collaborative group work and make it a
  requirement.
\item
  Establish how you will communicate in the forum.
\item
  Be aware of mutual blind spots in facilitating and observing others.
\item
  Watch out for different rhythms of intervention.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Co-facilitating wiki workflows}

A good place to begin for any group of co-facilitators working with a
wiki are Wikipedia's famous ``5 Pillars.''

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.
\item
  Wikipedia writes articles from a neutral point-of-view.
\item
  Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit, use, modify, and
  distribute.
\item
  Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil
  manner.
\item
  Wikipedia does not have firm rules.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Co-facilitating live sessions}

Learning experiences in live sessions are described in the article
\href{http://dmlcentral.net/blog/howard-rheingold/learning-reimagined-participatory-peer-global-online}{Learning
Re-imagined: Participatory, Peer, Global, Online} by Howard Rheingold,
and many of these points are revisited in the handbook section on
\href{http://peeragogy.org/real-time-meetings/}{real-time tools}. But we
want to emphasize one point here:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Howard Rheingold}: Remember you came together
  with your peers to accomplish something, not to discuss an agenda or
  play with online tools; keep everything as easily accessible as
  possible to ensure you realize your goals.
\end{quote}
