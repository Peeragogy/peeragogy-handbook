Early on, active peeragogue Charlie Danoff
\href{http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/wiki/rolesdivision-labor}{suggested}
that someone take on the ``wrapper role'' -- do a weekly pre/post wrap,
so that new users would know the status the project is at any given
point in time. The project wiki
\href{http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/}{main page} also
serves as a ``wrapper'', and in Peeragogy, we check it from time to time
to make sure that it accurately represents the basic facts about the
project. Note that the ``wrapper role'' is similar to the integrative
function that is needed for commons-based peer production to work
(according to the theory proposed by Yochai Benkler, it is vital to have
both 1) the ability to contribute small pieces; 2) some ``integrative
function'' that stitches those pieces together. In Peeragogy, the Weekly
Roundup" by Christopher Tillman Neal served to engage and re-engage
members. Peeragogues began to eager watched for the weekly reports to
see if our teams or our names had been mentioned. When there was a
holiday or break, Chris would announce the hiatus, to keep the flow
going.
