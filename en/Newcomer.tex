% DK: I am not sure that this is a Pattern. It is a role for sure, but is it a solution to a problem? Maybe the name of the pattern is wrong. Something like Welcome Wagon? Something that evokes the response to the Newcomer.

\paragraph{Motivation} This pattern can help project participants be aware of the issues faced by newcomers, and cultivate a ``beginner's mind'' themselves.

\paragraph{Context}
% DK: This is an interesting point. I am not sure it is Context. Maybe Rationale?
When there's learning happening, it's because there is someone who is new to a topic, or to something about the topic.

\paragraph{Problem} Newcomers can feel overwhelmed by the amount of things to learn.  They
often don't know where to start.  They may have a bunch of ideas that the
oldtimers have never considered -- or they may think they have new
ideas, which are actually a different take on an old idea; see
\patternname{Reduce, reuse, recycle}. People who are new to the project can tell you what makes their participation difficult.  Since you're learning as you go as well, you can ask yourself the same question: what aspects of this encounter are difficult for me?  

% DK: This seems a little spare
\paragraph{Solution}

Instead of thinking of newcomers as ``them'', and trying to provide
solutions, we focus on newcomers as ``us'' -- which makes the search
for solutions that much more urgent.  We permit ourselves to ask naive
questions.  We entertain vague ideas.  We add concreteness by trying
\patternname{A specific project}.  We may then genuinely turn to
others for help.
% OSS: What about action research?
% similar... not handholding but interactive
We aim to foster a culture in which the focus for everyone is on
addressing our own learning challenges rather than on ``providing''
solutions for others \cite{boud2005peer}.
%
When you begin a new project, try to systematically take notes and
gather data to analyze and reflect upon later; leave artifacts for
other future newcomers to use and build upon in their own research.
In practice this may be a lot to ask for someone just joining a group,
but over time we may have many ways to structure our collective
engagement so that it leads to research cycles based on the ``action
research'' steps \emph{reflect}, \emph{plan}, \emph{act}, and
\emph{observe}.
% \footnote{\url{https://valenciacollege.edu/faculty/development/tla/actionResearch/ARP_softchalk/mobile_pages/index.html}}
Note that there is a parallel with the four facets \emph{assess},
\emph{convene}, \emph{organize}, \emph{cooperate} from Figure
\ref{fig:connections}.  The history of the action research approach,
with particular emphasis on educational applications, is surveyed in
\cite[Chapter 3]{mcniff2013action}.  One method for doing the
reflection\slash assessment step is presented in the
\patternname{Scrapbook} pattern.
%% Another related model is Wallas's \cite{wallas1926art} four-part model
%% of creative thought, consisting of repeated or overlapping cycles of
%% \emph{preparation}, \emph{incubation}, \emph{illumination}, and
%% \emph{verification}.
%% The ``cyclic'' aspect of such models is less
%% important than the fact that they they point out key ingredients for
%% constructive engagement \cite{engestrom199923}.
Be flexible: networked attention (even more so than rigid cycles
\cite{engestrom199923}) leads to new ways of knowing and expanded
access to knowledge-production \cite{gilbert2012being,wagner2008new}.


% DK: I can empathize :+) I wonder if there is a pattern that is missing. Vision? A clear articulation about what the effort is for
%
\paragraph{Rationale} 
%
A newcomer's confusion about how best to get involved or what the
point of all this actually is may be due to a lack of structure in the
project \patternname{Roadmap}.  Sharing vulnerability and confusion
gives us a chance to learn.
%
%% In the words of Antoine de Saint-Exup\'ery:
%% ``If you want to build a boat, do not instruct the men to saw wood,
%% stitch the sails, prepare the tools and organize the work,
%% but make them long for setting sail and travel to distant lands.''

% DK: The resolution should describe the circumstance after applying the solution. This seems to be describe the circumstance without the solution.
\paragraph{Resolution}
An awareness of the difficulties that newcomers face can help us be
more compassionate to ourselves and others.  We strengthen the
community by supporting all participants' \textbf{individuation}.  We
have a better chance of making the project useful for others if we're
clear about how it is useful to \emph{us}.  By welcoming newcomers, we
enhance the sense of \textbf{mutuality} with people who have never
encountered the project before, and learn together with them.  The
facts start to become useful when we understand how people perceive
them \cite{freire1982creating}.

%% the concrete reality consists not only of concrete facts and
%% (physical) things, but also includes the ways in which the people
%% involved with these facts perceive them. Thus in the last analysis,
%% for me, the concrete reality is the connection between subjectivity
%% and objectivity, never objectivity isolated from subjectivity.

\paragraph{Example 1} Wikipedia \patternnameplural{Newcomer} can make use of resources that
include a ``Teahouse'' where questions are welcomed, a platform
extension that changes the user interface for new editors, and lots of
documentation.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Teahouse}}%

The efforts of exceptional newcomers may be given special
recognition.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:The_New_Editor\%27s_Barnstar}}
Newcomer ``survival'' is of interest to the Wikimedia
Foundation.\footnote{\url{https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Newcomer_survival_models}}
However, ``Nearly all editors begin with a burst of activity, then
quickly tail off'' \cite{panciera2009wikipedians}.  The degree to
which those editors who are retained emphasize continuous upskilling
is somewhat less clear.  As regards learning their way around the
community, quantitative support exists \cite{panciera2009wikipedians}
for the claim that ``novice users learn the rules and conventions for
contributing both through observation and direct coaching from more
knowledgeable others'' \cite{bryant2005becoming}.

\paragraph{Example 2} It will often be pragmatic to connect
\patternnameplural{Newcomer} with employment directly, so that
the future university may see a closer coupling of science and
industry than would be found in the old Science Hall.  Inspiration can
be drawn the London-based freelancing cooperative Founders\&Coders,
which is able to offer intensive training in web development at no
cost to successful applicants.
