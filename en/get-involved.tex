\subsection{Hello and welcome!}

The peeragogy project was kicked off around the time of
\href{http://rheingold.com/}{Howard Rheingold's} January 23,
2012~\href{http://vimeo.com/35685124}{Regents Lecture} at UC Berkeley on
\emph{Social Media and Peer Learning: From Mediated Pedagogy to
Peeragogy}.~ We have put together a handbook about peer learning: you're
reading it -- maybe on \href{peeragogy.org}{our website}, or in your
hammock with the beverage of your choice and our
\href{http://www.lulu.com/shop/howard-rheingold-and-peeragogyorg-editors/the-peeragogy-handbook/paperback/product-20607425.html}{print
on demand} paperback.~ Or maybe you grabbed our
\href{http://peeragogy.net/peeragogy-handbook-v1-1.pdf}{free PDF} or
some other remixed version in some other format or flavor from some
other place (which would be
\href{http://peeragogy.org/resources/license/}{cool}!).

But: there's still
\href{http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-org-roadmap/}{more work to be
done}.~ We created this page because you might be interested in getting
involved in improving the book or furthering the project in other ways.~
If so, we're happy to have you aboard!

What you do here is largely up to you.~ Asking questions is actually
extremely helpful: there's almost always someone in our
\href{https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/107386162349686249470}{Google+
community} who would be happy to try to answer them, or refer you to
someone else who can. Or just poke around the public pages on
peeragogy.org and leave a comment or two.~ Better still, find an area
where you feel knowledgeable -- or are willing to learn -- and start
writing (or filming, dancing, drawing, building, etc.).
The goal we have in mind for our book is for it be a useful guide to
peer learning! To achieve that goal we have in mind multiple
opportunities for peers to contribute.~ Here's our current ``Top Ten''
list:

It's up to you. Instead of worrying too much about
\href{http://peeragogy.org/co-working/}{the rules}, or trying to master
all of the \href{http://peeragogy.org/resources/technologies/}{tools we
use} at all once, you can just jump in by joining our conversations, and
take advantage of the digital memory of the forum to rewind the
conversation all the way to the beginning (if you want to go that far),
listen in for a little bit if you want to, and jump in whenever you're
ready.~ There are always lots of things to do (including many that no
one here has thought of yet).~ We won't know what you're up to until you
speak up. You can have a look at the outstanding tasks and teams that
are listed on
\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2I-z-Pt5NUKk-fpy4jsqxFeXbWS4ao4sIhkxCcRVeI/edit\#}{this
Google Doc}: our
\href{http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-org-roadmap/}{roadmap} is a useful
shared resource too.~ You can add to these at any time.

We regularly use Google+, Google Hangouts, forums, and email to
communicate asynchronously and pretty much continuously. We also meet
irregularly as a group for synchronous audio-video sessions. Further
details about all these methods of communication can be found below.

In short: here's how it works:
